This draft was a bit atypical, in that it involved some "three for all" matches as well
as a 2v2. I'm going to record the results, but not include them in data tracking overall.

Three player games:

Game 1: Xander wins, Dom and Casey lose.
Game 2: Casey wins, Dom and Xander lose.
Game 3: Xander wins, Dom and Casey lose.

2v2:

Game 1: Paul + Xander win
Game 2: Casey + Dom win

Total:

Xander: 5 - 2
Casey: 3 - 3
Paul: 1 - 1
Dom: 1 - 4
