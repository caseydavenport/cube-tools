Did a 4-person houseman draft today for the first time! It was pretty cool. We used the following parameters:

4 players
5 card hands
12 cards on the table
3 swaps each
The resulting decks were powerful and synergistic, and the process felt pretty quick and easy to learn.

An interesting thing - just like the last draft, two of the four players built sacrifice decks! Something is clearly off that sacrifice is being signaled so strongly (although I'll admit, one of the two players almost always builds a sac deck). I will need to think about the signposts over the coming days.

A few notes from the draft:

- Boros aggro did really well. 7-2 in terms of games, and generally just felt strongly in control. The star was Kor Duelist, combined with various reconfigure creatures like Ogre-head helm and Rabbit Battery. Sai of the Shinobi proved modestly useful as well.
- Vampire-based sacrifice came together well - with a few key pieces combining really nicely. Specifically, Pitiless Pontiff, Kalastria Highborn and Mavren Fein, Dusk Apostle. Whisper, Blood Liturgist also showed up and contributed well.
- Slimefoot, the Stowaway and Mayhem Devil saw action but neither really got to go off.
- Chandra, Hope's Beacon is appearing fairly overpowered in this cube. I'm going to be keeping my eye on her. She's a very fun card though so maybe it's not a problem. This time, it was in conjunction with Overrun (several times) that each resulted in a win.

Things I'll be looking into:

- Too many signposts for sacrifice theme. What other signpost slots can I buff?
- Support for Slimefoot - can I find more saprolings?
- Boros is strong. One more equipment payoff would make it feel like a theme.
- How to blend the Boros artifact/equipment theme into adjacent blue and/or black artifact themes.

In terms of raw games:

- Casey: 7-2
- Grant: 4-4
- Jen: 3-5
- Matt: 3-6
