## Decks

**Food**

Food deck was signposted by [[Greta, Sweettooth Scourge]].

- Food density is a little low in the cube, but despite that, in a matchup against my lands/retrace deck, the Food deck saw success
using [[Virtue of Persistence]] to reanimate food producers to recursively generate tokens, then sacrifice them in conjunction with [[Sanguine Bond]] to drain the opponent.
- In a matchup against UG counters, it really synergized to combine Greta, [[Ravenous Squirrel]], [[The Goose Mother]] and [[Master of Etherium]] to
great effect.
- In the matchup against the RW aggro deck, it took a bit too long for the Food deck to stabilize the board and the aggro deck was able to outpace the food deck for a win. Need more data on this one - on the one hand, I want aggro decks to perform like this in order to keep greedier decks in check. I do need to consider whether there are enough counter-play options available for the food deck though.

**Lands**

Two versions of a lands deck appeared in this draft.

I made a BRG lands-in-the-graveyard deck based around [[Worm Harvest]], [[Life from the Loam]], [[Orcish Lumberjack]] primarily. It was blended into a recursive spells-matter theme via [[Young Pyromancer]], [[Saheeli, Sublime Artificer]], etc.
- This deck was a bit slow to get started against the Food deck, but managed to get the engine running quick enough to seriously threaten a win by dredging [[Life from the Loam]] and milling [[Worm Harvest]] and a couple of lands into the graveyard in one swoop. However, the Foods stabilized in the late game with [[Virtue of Persistence]] and eeked out a nail-biting win with 4 life left.
- In my matchup with the WUR aggro/control goodstuff deck, I again got off to a decent start but [[Welcoming Vampire]] was too strong of a card advantage engine for me to overcome and it resulted in a [[Dream Trawler]] smashing my face in before I could finish the game.
- In my matchup against the WUG Titania deck (mentioned below) I had the upper hand essentially all game, but the opponent managed to play Titania and Fall of the Thran in the same turn, swinging me with a dozen 5/3s.

In each of these match-ups, my deck seemed like it was doing well and had a good chance of winning, up until a certain point in the late-game where the opponent managed to claw back at the final moment. So, nothing especially dire, but this flavor of midrange might need some tuning. Specifically, better removal options and ways to increase aggression.

There was also a WUG land sacrifice deck built around [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]], [[Knight of the Reliquary]], and [[Fall of the Thran]]. This felt more of a control deck with a multi-card finisher. In the aggro matchup, it was on the back foot the whole game but had sufficient answers to the threats presented that it was able to win on the very last turn with 0 cards remaining in the deck! It relied on several pieces of white removal and [[Lion Sash]] to eat away graveyards and swing for big damage just before being milled. [[Restless Vinestalk]] also proved a valuable game piece in this matchup.

**+1/+1 counters**

This was a UG counters deck with [[Wilderness Reclamation]]. It had a solid showing against the WUG land/control deck and made good use of [[Hardened Scales]] there, though ultimately lost. I didn't see as much of this deck, but from what I did see it appeared that it was a bit slow getting off the ground. I don't think there are changes to be made yet, but I do want to see [[Wilderness Reclamation]] do well in the cube.

**Aggro**

A RW aggro deck was drafted this time around. It didn't pick up on some of the more synergistic elements of the equipment theme, but still managed to be quite threatening, ending up with a 2-1 record overall. I think within this draft, the balance seemed pretty good. It certainly punished slower decks enough to make it a viable strategy, but control still had a fighting chance. If anything, I think this deck may have been too threatening rather than not enough.

**Control? Aggro? Midrange?**

There was also a WUR deck with some aggro elements, but that was more of an aggro / control hybrid than anything else. This deck largely relied on early board state and control to delay long enough to play [[Dream Trawler]]. [[Dream Trawler]] generally will win the game if you manage to attack with it, but it turns out there are a surprising number of ways to deal with [[Dream Trawler]] in the cube. Board wipes and tappers like [[Blinding Mage]], for example. However, I still think this card is way too swingy for my liking. If you manage to attack with it, you effectively win. Your opponent has to essentially just get lucky to be able to deal with it. So even if it's more answerable than I initially imagined, I still am not a fan of the game play it promotes.

## Other notes / summary

- Drafters continue to get really strong red/blue spells-matter signals throughout the draft. Might want to tone those down a tiny bit.
- [[Curator of mysteries]] so far hasn't been doing what I want. It's just a 4/4 flier in most games, which is fine but not the synergy piece I was hoping for.
- [[Lion Sash]] has yet again proved its ability to take over games.
- [[Dream Trawler]] is on watch. I need control finishers, but this one feels potentially too oppressive. I didn't enjoy playing it in my deck, and I certainly didn't enjoy playing against it. I wish it didn't have one of lifelink or hexproof.
- [[The Binding of Titans]] is a bit of a feelbad. I still like the card, but it feels bad when it misses. It milled my opponent's wrath early-game.
- [[Wilderness Reclamation]] is pretty cool. I should spend some time thinking about it as a build around.
- Could use a few more typed dual lands to make [[Knight of the Reliquary]] more useful. In decks that want to run him, a lot of the lands also want to be nonbasic.

## Changes to consider

- [[Call of the Herd]] as another great green option with flashback.
- [[Wrenn and Six]] is just a perfect fit for the lands theme in this cube. Is he too powerful?
- [[Tough Cookie]] would really bolster the Food and artifact animation themes.
- [[Elvish Reclaimer]] might help make the retrace deck more aggressive.
- [[Dragon's Rage Channeler]] and [[Unholy Heat]] hit some of the deficiencies of the RG graveyard deck mentioned above.
- [[Grim Flayer]] is another option for the graveyard-matters theme.
- [[Ruthless Sniper]] is a better signal for discard than [[Curator of Mysteries]].
- Add more WG typed dual lands (and WX in general)
- Replace WU dual lands with always tapped, to slow down the WU control deck.
