Just a quick grid draft, only played one game.

It dragged on a bit. My deck was very much a control deck, and my opponent was a bit more of a control-leaning midrange deck with a few spells synergies. I ended up winning the long-game with [[Wrath of God]] combined with [[Reveillark]] and [[Restless Vinestalk]].

[[Gruff Triplets]] made an appearance and was handily dealt with using [[Chandra, Beacon of Hope]] and [[Tamiyo, Compleated Sage]].

[[Gilded Goose]] was another MVP, extending my runway long enough to get my key pieces / board wipes.
