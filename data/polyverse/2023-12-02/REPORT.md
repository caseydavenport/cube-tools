## Draft report 12/02/2023

This was an 8-player online draft done using Draftmancer. Drafted decks included:

- BG Titania / delirium midrange
- RB aggro
- UR spells-matter
- WUB flicker / control
- WRG go-wide + anthems midrange
- RG +1/+1 counters + stompy creatures midrange
- BR aggro/midrange
- WG wraths and 'goyf stuff

I have a lot of thoughts on this one! A bunch of cards stood out to me - some positively, some negatively, and some both.

### Cards that played well

These are mostly from my own deck or decks that I played against or have first-hand experience with from this draft. Basing this not purely on power level but more on whether they provided interesting game play that I enjoyed.

>>> <<[[!Moon-Circuit Hacker]][[!Fungal Infection]][[!Call of the Herd]][[!Phoenix Chick]]>> <<<

- [[Fungal Infection]] - was great in the aggro deck. Consistently removed blockers and generated a body.
- [[Phoenix Chick]] - was even recurred from the graveyard, really enjoyed seeing this one succeed.
- [[Call of the Herd]] - Solid bodies. Exactly what green was missing. Very happy with the value provided here, even without seeing it in a GY synergy deck yet.
- [[Moon-Circuit Hacker]] - First time seeing play, and a lot of generated value.

>>> <<[[!Mosswood Dreadknight]][[!Fearless Fledgling]][[!Kor Skyfisher]][[!Faerie Dreamthief]]>> <<<

- [[Mosswood Dreadknight]] - good body, recurring, improved deck consistency.
- [[Fearless Fledgling]] - got big as expected. Not always having flying was confusing, as expected.
- [[Kor Skyfisher]] - continues to shine as a synergy piece / enabler. Returns cycling lands, returns ETB threats like [[The Wandering Emperor]], etc.
- [[Faerie Dreamthief]] - Good card selection / advantage. Will work well in the aggro deck also when it comes together.

>>> <<[[!The Wandering Emperor]][[!Angel of Salvation]][[!Snapcaster Mage]][[!Titania, Protector of Argoth]]>> <<<

- [[The Wandering Emperor]] - surprisingly didn't feel as oppressive or overwhelming as I expected, which is why she's in this list. But she's definitely pushing my power level limit a bit at 4 mana.
- [[Angel of Salvation]] - First time she showed up in a while, but was very impactful and felt fair. Flash / convoke combination is fun.
- [[Snapcaster Mage]] - First time seeing play, wasn't overwhelming but did win a very close game. Becomes really strong in combination with bounce spells like [[Aether Tradewinds]].
- [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] - I need to not forget about her ETB. Otherwise solid. Usually assures value due to an immediate fetch.

>>> <<[[!Scavenging Ooze]][[!Eternal Witness]][[!Empty the Warrens]][[!Inexorable Blob]]>> <<<

- [[Scavenging Ooze]] - Life gain was key in the aggro matchup in a way [[Lion Sash]] would not have helped. I think I like the creature limitation more than the permanent one as well.
- [[Eternal Witness]] - I feel safe when I have this card in my hand. Just solid.
- [[Empty the Warrens]] - Always surprises me. In the right deck, this is pumping out 4-12 tokens even without any other storm support. It's not as aggressive as other token generators, more a control payoff.
- [[Inexorable Blob]] - I didn't have a perfect delirium deck, but he still managed to be a solid threat that was fun to play with / build around. First time trying delirium in the cube and I enjoyed the challenge.

>>> <<[[!Mizzium Tank]][[!Marshal's Anthem]][[!Knight of the Ebon Legion]][[!Tarmogoyf]]>> <<<

- [[Mizzium Tank]] is a really solid card that presents a little mini game in itself, which I really enjoy the play patterns of. It's powerful, but requires a bit of deck building to get the maximum value out of.
- [[Marshal's Anthem]] saw extensive play for the first time in this draft. A 6-mana reanimation spell isn't very good, but the added anthem effect makes it worth it. At the same time, a 4 mana anthem is pretty bad - but the modality in the late-game to reanimate a creature or two helps put this above something like [[Glorious Anthem]].
- [[Knight of the Ebon Legion]] also finally saw some play, and was quite powerful. It demands an answer, but doesn't immediately take over the game (it will eventually), so feels like it hits a sweet spot. It even led to some interesting game play where you want to leave some creatures unblocked so that you lose enough life to gain a counter, which is a unique impact on blocker assignment.
- [[Tarmogoyf]] is a big boy in every game. So many things going into the graveyard, he's guaranteed value, but certainly dealable - no trample, no abilities, etc. He encourages mild draft-around.

### Cards to watch

These are cards I experienced (in one way or another) that either felt too powerful, or didn't provide fun enough gameplay, or both.

>>> <<[[!Dark Confidant]][[!Nobilis of War]][[!Glory of Warfare]][[!Gruff Triplets]]>> <<<

- [[Dark Confidant]] is really powerful and might need to come out. BR aggro could use some more card draw though, and I like the deck-building constraint that confidant puts on the drafter. I am thinking I should add another 1-2 impulsive draw abilities to red, as well as perhaps a bit more scry, and look again at the RB lands. I may also try out [[Blood Scrivener]] in this spot for a similar but less potent ability. The thing is, [[Dark Confidant]] is a huge draft-time signal for aggro that I am hesitant to lose. It really impacts draft time decision making, even if when it hits the field it's a bit of a power outlier. I think it deserves a few more test runs to see how it impacts the environment before cutting it.
- I am thinking about cards like [[Nobilis of War]] and [[Glory of Warfare]]. These two in particular were added to encourage go-wide weenie and token decks, which they definitely do. But, I think these two don't come with quite enough of a deck building cost (aside from being gold) to make them appeal to me. The narrow mana costs mean you will likely be handed these in the draft, and they apply equally well to larger threats as they do to smaller ones. Similarly, these aggressive token decks really want to get off the ground _fast_, so [[Intangible Virtue]] is more up their alley. I did enjoy the synergies between the Boros gold cards and Gruul cards such as [[Rubblebelt Rioters]], though. One or both of those Boros cards may be on the chopping block to pull in more fetches, or "power matters" cards that require a bit more build-around. Another angle here is that as the aggro decks get better, these two cards in particular will become more of a liability due to their mana costs - especially [[Nobilis of War]]. That said, I think there are enough mono-colored anthem effects that I like better ([[Intangible Virtue]], [[Marshal's Anthem]], [[Ajani Goldmane]], [[Meadowboon]]) and more interesting gold anthems ([[Kellan, the Fae-Blooded]]) that these two will probably get cut.
- [[Gruff Triplets]] were always going to be powerful. They have won all games they have been cast so far, this time beating a deck with both [[Wrath of God]] and [[Day of Judgment]] in it - two of the best answers available. Considering I am also trying to drop the average mana value of the cube, these guys seem like their time is short. The battle bewteen [[Gruff Triplets]] and [[Multani, Yavamaya's Avatar]] comes closer to an end. I may cut both - the more I lower the mana value of the cube, the more I enjoy the gameplay. [[Esika's Chariot]] fills a similar role as a midrange top-end that is hard to remove, but at a lower cost and with less of a "bomb" impact on the game.

>>> <<[[!Reckless Rage]][[!Severed Strands]][[!Dark Ritual]][[!Lion Sash]]>> <<<

- [[Reckless Rage]]. I finally witnessed the failure case of not having a creature in play, and it felt bad. Would much rather have a [[Thrill of Possibility]], [[Forked Bolt]], etc. here.
- [[Severed Strands]] for much the same reason - it's useless if you have no board, and that's often when you really need a removal spell.
- [[Dark Ritual]] is too often a dead draw in the late game, and can be pretty swingy early game. Either you out-resource your opponent to great effect, or you go down a card and effectively two-for-one yourself when your threat is removed. It's a classic card and I love that, but with so many more interesting effects in demand this one might not meet the bar any more.
- [[Lion Sash]] is rarely cast without taking over the game. It takes a decent amount of mana investment to get there, but the fact that it can hide from removal as an equipment makes it pretty problematic. A bit more artifact removal is also probably in order.

>>> <<[[!Chandra, Hope's Beacon]][[!Quillspike]][[!Scavenger Drake]]>> <<<

- [[Chandra, Hope's Beacon]] has been on my watch list for a bit. I think she is still a keeper for now. She's quite a power outlier, but at 6 mana it's not a given she'll even get cast. I also want to see her come down in other decks besides the UR spells deck before making too much of a Judgment.
- [[Quillspike]] was originally added as an old favorite of mine for the synergies with _persist_. But a 1/1 for 3 mana is pretty bad as a base rate, and the upside if it goes infinite is perhaps too scary. So in a way, this is a very swingy card that is either a feel bad for the person casting it, _or_ it's a feel bad for the person playing against it. I have discovered that I still really like -1/-1 counters, but dislike highly parasitic synergies and individual cards with a really high variance in effectiveness.
- [[Scavenger Drake]] may have been pushed out by the recent changes to increase aggressiveness. Another case of a 4 mana 1/1 flier being a really bad base rate. A growing theme is that I want to raise the floor on some of the more synergistic pieces to avoid feel bad situatoins when they don't come together, and just generally increase their appeal. The downside of this will be that synergies might be harder to put together or less obvious, but that's OK.

### Notes from the draft (in no particular order)

My recent tweaks to removal definitely helped aggro in my matchup, which is great! It's not desirable trading life or tempo in these matchups. Usually I feel pretty good about casting [[Spider Food]] or [[Ulcerate]] in my midrange deck, but it's a sad moment casting it against [[Phoenix Chick]] for a sizable tempo or life loss. [[Ulcerate]] felt _really_ bad when playing against aggro. I think this is a good thing - it's the type of tension I was trying to add and that wouldn't exist if aggro wasn't supported well enough. I want most removal spells to be better in some matchups and worse in others, rather than generically good in order to force decision making and make sure the right removal finds the drafter who needs it. Need to see how [[Ulcerate]] handles in other matchups.

I really enjoy the higher land density. When the draft is over and it comes time to deck-build, it means way more of my drafted cards are actually playable. I will likely add even more - aiming for 60 fixing lands total. I will likely break singleton and go double-fetch lands since they are effectively "hybrid" cards instead of dual-color "gold" cards like other fixing lands, making them usable in a greater number of decks. I ended up having plenty of land-sac outlets in my Titania deck, but fetch lands fuel all sorts of synergies I care about - _delerium_, _sacrifice_, _delve_. [[Worm Harvest]], [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]], [[Tarmogoyf]], [[Knight of the Reliquary]], [[Grim Discovery]], [[Dragon's Rage Channeler]], [[Treasure Cruise]] etc. There was also a common thread of some decks having poor fixing - some of this was just prioritization during the draft. More horizon lands besides the ones already there feel like a great option for similar reasons, also mixing well with draw-twice synergies. If only they were a full cycle - Rakdos especially could use one. More "painful" fixing will also further punish greedy decks, the impact of this punishment is becoming more apparent in recent drafts (but is still not quite where I want it to be). The more risky I can make greedy strategies, the more flexibility I get in terms of power-level in the top end of the curve. [[Gruff Triplets]] is a really cool card mechanically, but it's not very fun for your opponent if it's a guaranteed cast, nor does it impose any deck-building cost if all games are guaranteed to hit 6-mana on the field. Paying life to fix your manabase eventually becomes a real tradeoff to consider, and making the most expensive spells a potential liability is one of my current goals for the environment in order to discourage "biggest deck wins" gameplay.

There's a small power-matters theme emerging from the set with cards like [[Dreadhorde Butcher]], [[Marshal's Anthem]], [[Dreadhorde Arcanist]], [[Rubblebelt Rioters]], [[Domri's Ambush]], [[Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin]], [[Domri, Anarch of Bolas]], and [[Ignoble Hierarch]] that can either synergize with +1/+1 counters, equipment, and abilities like _exalted_, or go-wide strategies like tokens and sacrifice. I like this incremental build rather than a "greater than power X" model. While I'm likely pulling [[Glory of Warfare]] for being a bit boring, I think cards like [[Qasali Pridemage]] fit nicely here - the payoff isn't as high, but it's cheaper, provides flexibility through interaction with artifacts and enchantments, and presents interesting game-time decisions. I had previously been off of exalted as an ability due to the tension it introduces in some board states, but I think combined with some of the above cards it actually provides some pretty interesting choices. [[Ignoble Hierarch]] into [[Qasali Pridemage]] into [[Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin]] would be very cool.

The spells-matter deck is loaded with Planeswalker options, and really just options in general. This deck is very easy to build, and could use being taken down a notch. Just in terms of Planeswalkers we have Chandra, Saheeli, Jace, and Ral. We really don't need so many of them. I think to start, [[Ral, Storm Conduit]] is on the chopping block. He's probably my favorite of the bunch as far as power-level and abilities, but he's also the most narrow - only working in a deck running both blue AND red, whereas the others can all find themselves in a variety of decks. I want to trim cards here that are the most narrow, because it increase competition for the card pool and means building this deck will require a bit more draft-time strategy. Least likely to cut is [[Saheeli, Sublime Artificer]] who is such a fun card promoting a diverse set of synergies - tokens, artifacts, spells - and fitting in any deck that runs blue _or_ red due to the hybrid cost. In general, I think this deck is really strong and taking 2-3 cards out from this area wouldn't hurt the deck too much, but would make it harder to put together as consistently. Other options on the chopping block include [[Mischievous Chimera]] and [[Brineborn Cutthroat]] - mostly due to their redundancy. Swapping for some payoffs in other colors is another option here to stretch the deck a bit thinner.

Lands are an area of limited interaction. Cards like [[Restless Vinestalk]] and [[Maze of Ith]] are especially powerful because they are hard for your opponent to interact with. I think some small amount of additional land-interaction is probably a good thing to make these cards less of a sure-thing. As a general principal, I think there should be options to interact with all card types in all zones of the game. I do want some types / zones (lands, graveyard) to be _harder_ to interact with, but not impossible. The cube already has a few options for lands - [[Field of Ruin]], [[Beast Within]], [[Boseiju, Who Endures]] - but a handful of other options would be nice - especially if they can be added without being too narrow / parasitic. [[Rishadan Port]] is a good example of a card that would shine against [[Maze of Ith]], but is also just generically viable for resource denial. [[Wasteland]] might be too strong for my cube, but would seriously buff aggro decks who don't need the mana as much as they want to deny their opponent of it. [[Song of the Dryads]] is flexible, and can deal with lands that have troublesome activated abilities.

The go-wide + anthem deck this game felt.. bigger rather than wider. I feel like the balance between the number of big payoffs (think [[Nobilis of War]], [[Glory of Warfare]], etc.) and the number of enablers (think [[Raise the Alarm]]) isn't quite balanced. I'd like to swap out some of those big payoffs and instead make it much easier for that deck to amass more bodies.

A RG [[Hardened Scales]] deck came together fairly well. Cards like [[Roaring Earth]] seem to play well here, and more fetch lands will buff this further. I think I need to do a deep-dive on the various +1/+1 counter driven decks currently available to see how they curve out and how consistent they can be. I am alternatively considering really paring down the number of +1/+1 counter specific enablers and payoffs, and instead thinking of it entirely as an incidental synergy with a few other cards (e.g., with power-matters, persist, tokens, enchantments-matter). I've mentioned in an earlier post that I think there's potential for a blending of "enchantments matter" and "+1/+1 counters" in the future - GW already has a fair number of enchantments, and cards like [[Setessan Champion]] can glue them together.

As I've dropped the overall mana curve, I think white hasn't kept up. That is to say, it's still a bit top-heavy, with cards like [[Cloudgoat Ranger]], [[Reveillark]], [[Angel of Salvation]] taking up three expensive slots. Despite being one of the aggressive colors, white still has the highest average mana value of any color in the cube.
