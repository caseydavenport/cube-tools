# Cards that did well

>>> <<[[!Oust]][[!Ephara's Dispersal]][[!Unearth]][[!Mesmeric Fiend]]>> <<<

- I already knew I liked [[Oust]], but this draft further solidified that. Casting it on your own creatures for a bit of life gain is a fun play pattern, and the fact that it's 1 mana is key for cards like [[Dreadhorde Arcanist]]. Sorcery speed means additional decisions forced on the caster, which in my opinion is a good thing overall.

- [[Ephara's Dispersal]] did well, providing good tempo advantage. The _surveil_ is great late-game if you want to clear lands from the top of your deck, even if you don't have any more explicit graveyard synergies going on. It only gets better with cards like [[Tarmogoyf]].

- [[Unearth]] is a card I already knew I liked. Just wanted to call it out here because its modality provides really fun decisions. Unearthing [[Snapcaster Mage]] and then casting [[Unearth]] again is very cool. So is cycling it with [[Archfiend of Ifnir]] in play.

- [[Mesmeric Fiend]] finally saw decent action and I think was great. I was thinking of doing a swap for [[Kitesail Freebooter]], but there might be room for both actually.

>>> <<[[!Raven's Crime]][[!Inti, Seneschal of the Sun]][[!Malfegor]][[!Halo Forager]]>> <<<

- [[Raven's Crime]] is cheap, recurrable, and annoying to play against. You can't feel too bad about it though because you get to decide what to discard. It got more than one cast in a game a couple of times this draft.

- [[Initi, Seneschal of the Sun]] finally saw real play, and did as well as expected. Discarding [[Oust]] to buff a creature, and then flashing it back with [[Snapcaster Mage]] is a great play. Especially when [[Dragon's Rage Channeler]] is sitting top-deck for you to cast.

- [[Malfegor]] saw action after a long period of none. He won a game at the wire. Yes, he's got a tough casting cost - but a 6/6 flier with upside is actually good in this cube.

- [[Halo Forager]] is _sometimes_ even better than [[Snapcaster Mage]]. A 3/1 flier is great, and it can target your opponent's graveyard - providing potentially a lot more options.

>>> <<[[!Remand]][[!Sparring Construct]][[!Throne of the God-Pharoh]][[!Parallel Lives]]>> <<<

- [[Remand]], [[Memory Lapse]], [[Reprieve]], and [[Delay]] all worked wonders this round. Each plays differently, but the tempo advantage is real and that's the sort of environment I want. It would be a problem if a turn or two of tempo gained at the right moment wasn't impactful.

- [[Sparring Construct]] continues to over perform my expectations. It's freeing to willingly chump block in order to get a counter, or force a difficult blocking decision for your opponent. Very similar to [[Perilous Myr]] in that regard.

- [[Throne of the God-Pharoh]] is especially good in an aggro deck, but brings surprising value with even just a small handful of creatures.

- [[Parallel Lives]] is not too much of a surprise. But it can get pretty bonkers with cards like [[Saproling Migration]]. Enjoy that it's a dead card in many decks, and very very powerful in others.

>>> <<[[!Galepowder Mage]][[!Acidic Slime]][[!Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse]][[!Bloodsoaked Champion]]>> <<<

- [[Galepowder Mage]] is one that I've been considering cutting due to repetitive play patterns. However, it is uniquely positioned as both a synergistic threat (flying, flickering your own dudes) and a solid answer to some of the more powerful cards in the cube. It handily deals with cards like [[The Goose Mother]], [[Gruff Triplets]], and decks that rely on things like equipment and +1/+1 counters.

- [[Acidic Slime]] has been on my list to cut for a bit since it's not picked up very often. A 5 mana 2/2 isn't great, but I think drafters might be underestimating the value of destroying a land and having deathtouch. The two times I played it, it was very effective. There aren't many answers to cards like [[Restless Vinestalk]], which left unanswered will win games quickly. This makes [[Acidic Slime]] one to take a second look at.

- [[Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse]] has been _fine_. Not great, just fine. The fact that you can get at most one token per-turn is pretty limiting, and makes it a bit challenging to keep up with more aggresive strategies. It requires a lot of build-around, but it's also pretty fun when it does pay off. I am hoping / expecting that the "OK" gameplay I've seen so far is closer to her floor than her ceiling.

- [[Bloodsoaked Champion]] did _major_ work this draft. It's so good at being aggresive, and the play pattern of attacking to take out a blocker, then re-casting him is so relentless and oppressive, and I love it. I might need to think about answers for this type of card, though. Perhaps a touch more graveyard hate, exile removal, or creatures with 3+ toughness.

>>> <<[[!Dress Down]][[!Deprive]][[!Merfolk Looter]]>> <<<

- [[Dress Down]] saw play for the first time in earnest and did spectacularly. It plays so nicely as a combat trick and really adds a bit of a puzzle-like quality to deciding the best way to get value out of it. Using it to remove effects like _flying_ and _first strike_ really catch your opponent off-guard. Worst-case you can flash it in at the end of your opponents turn to draw a card - effecitvely cycling {2} (without the discard trigger). It's also an easy way to get an enchantment in your graveyard for things that care about that.

- [[Deprive]] pulled a lot of weight for me this draft. I didn't pick up [[counterspell]], and so having another hard counter was really key. The land pickup wasn't especially relevant, but it could easily be - either for landfall, or cards like [[Boseiju, Who Endures]]. I'm also excited for the eventual synergy with [[Tameshi, Reality Architect]] should I eventually add that one.

- [[Merfolk Looter]] also did a lot for me. In my deck, which was exceptionally low curving, I could confidently chuck lands to the looter even early in the game. This enabled me to get the counterspells, etc., that I needed in order to stabilize.

# Cards to monitor

>>> <<[[!Fatestitcher]][[!Magma Phoenix]][[!Jace, Arcane Strategist]][[!River Kelpie]]>> <<<

These cards all fall into a category of "priced out" - they are a bit too expensive for what they bring to the table at this point.

[[River Kelpie]] in particular is one that I am feeling sad about, as it's a card that I want to succeed. I still feel it has potential, but need to think carefully about how much I want to invest in making it shine. I will give it a few more tries to see if I can make it work.

>>> <<[[!Hostage Taker]][[!Oona's Grace]][[!Rite of Replication]][[!Hedron Crab]]>> <<<

- [[Hostage Taker]] is really powerful. One thing I like is the tension about when to cast [[Hostage Taker]] - can you make it another turn before it's removed or do you need to steal something cheaper that you can play right away? I want to let him play out a bit more to see what sorts of counter-play show up. I can imagine things like flicker, counterspells, instant-speed removal all work well here.

- [[Oona's Grace]] might be too "cute" at this point. 3-mana to draw a card is a rather bad base rate. And while there are plenty of ways to add upside ([[Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse]], [[Rielle, the Everwise]], [[Faerie Vandal]], etc.), I am not sure they do enough to make it worth keeping.

- [[Rite of Replication]] was added originally as a control payoff. But I think it's not a great fit for a few reasons. For one, you really want to cast it kicked - and it's not a good bet to expect games to last to 9 mana as the cube stands. Secondly, control decks would rather deal with enemy threats than simply copy them, making the unkicked cost a bit of a let-down. I think this one is probably coming out for something like [[Repeal]]. I think blue wants to provide more pure "control" effects and things to do in the early game and can rely on other colors for win conditions.

- [[Hedron Crab]] has been in the cube since day 1, and has not once been mainboarded in a deck. I'm still of the opinion that there's a place for him somewhere, but my drafters clearly disagree. In the spirit of giving blue more cheap things to do at instant speed, [[Spectral Sailor]] seems like a lovely one-for-one replacement.

>>> <<[[Oathsworn Vampire]]>> <<<

- [[Oathsworn Vampire]] doesn't do much. The fact that he comes into play tapped is a big bummer, and so aggressive decks don't really want him. He could maybe fit into a bit of a combo-y sacrifice deck with blood artist type effects, but I think that role is a just a bit too niche considering no other decks want him.

# General notes

- Lands were much more tightly contested this time around, likely due to the success of decks with higher fixing in the last draft. This just reinforces my suspicion that doubling up on fetches will be a great improvement.

- Fight spells are confusing when one of the targets is removed in response - I still don't quite have the rules internalized. They are also a good way to 2-for-1 yourself. Despite reading about this many times, I've finally witnessed it in a way that makes me need to reconsider fight a bit. Nothing major, but might want to think about alternatives to cards like [[Tail Swipe]].

- The +1/+1 counter deck managed to make some pretty big creatures, but was missing a bit of reach. I think this could definitely be mitigated with the current set by adding more white fliers, but I also noticed that we're missing tools to give creatures temporary trample. I've got my eye on a few cards to improve this. [[The Huntsman's Redemption]] is very cool. I love the flavor, I love that it touches on tokens, sacrifice, enchantments, and just general midrange aggression. It will help with _delirium_ and similar strategies as well, and also gives creatures trample (and gives your opponent some time to prep). Also considering [[Rile]] as a cheap cantriping trample enabler.

- Love that [[Virtue of Persistence]] forecasts itself to your opponent. It's really powerful, but gives your opponent a chance to dig for or save enchantment removal to prepare.

- The "discard matters" deck didn't come together in its best form this draft, so it's hard to draw too many conclusions. One thing that I think I can conclude is that it could use a bit more in the way of relevant early-game play. Cards like [[Ruthless Sniper]] and [[Bitter Triumph]] will fill these holes well, as will [[Blazing Rootwalla]] and other cheap madness cards. I still have faith in [[Malfegor]].

- My UG counterspells / threats / draw-twice deck was a bit of a miss. It was somewhat competitive at times, but laregely outclassed by every other deck in some way or another. I suspect I might have just drafted this one poorly, and that not much is needed to "fix" this, but I'll be keeping an eye on it. I'd like to introduce some more _flash_ across W/U/G any way, which should buff this incidentally. I am also looking at ways to give blue more 1-mana things to do at instant speed - especially counterspells - but other control-y plays as well. I found it very common to have an extra mana left open that I wanted to cantrip with at least. I think this would help increase the viability of a true draw-go control deck.

- The BR sacrifice / aggro deck came together very well once again, in addition to a RG aggro deck of similar speed. The prospect of matching against this sort of aggro deck should be on every drafter's mind. One thing is that red burn has lots of options for killing creatures with 3 or less toughness, and most mid-range decks top out at creatures with 3 toughness. This means it's really hard for decks to stabilize at all against the best aggressive red decks. I think I will look at just a tiny downshift of one or two spells into the 2-damage range, and ever-so-slightly increase the number of less aggresive cards with 3 or 4 toughness to balance this a bit better.

# Cards to consider

- [[The Huntsman's Redemption]]
- [[Rile]]
- [[Ruthless Sniper]]
- [[Repeal]]
- [[Spectral Sailor]]
- [[Stern Scolding]]
- [[Spell Snare]]
- [[Adanto Vanguard]] for more white aggression and life-gain payoff.
