# Notes

Overall I think this was a pretty balanced draft. Most of the matches went to three games, which is a good sign that no single deck was vastly outperforming all others. Some games seemed to have slow or irrelevant starts, which is something I will want to diagnose, as one of my goals is to avoid games starting with a few turns of inconsequential back and forth.

###  3-0 {w}{b}{g} lands

This deck was very sweet. It had a solid curve, with a very hard to beat top-end with [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]], [[Worm Harvest]], and [[Cloudgoat Ranger]]. Even though I lost both my games to this one, I felt like I had a chance in both of them, so I am left feeling like aggro is still a viable answer to this deck. The lands deck is strong, and I suspect this build of it was on the stronger side of what it can be. Time will tell.

[[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] is now a beast. With double fetches, she's an easy first pick. I think it's time to think about some counter-play, which I think can come in a couple of forms:

- Graveyard hate. The ability to get rid of those pesky fetches from the graveyard means it's harder for Titania to get instant value.
- A bit more targeted creature removal across the board. I think I could easily support up to 10 more removal spells in the cube, but may start with fewer.
- Perhaps even remove a few of the extra land sac outlets that were originally added before 2x fetches.

I've already added some graveyard hate, and there are a couple more pieces coming in soon. Something like [[Engineered Explosives]] is also a very powerful answer to the tokens Titania creates.

[[Courser of Kruphix]] was, as expected, pretty hard to deal with. Four toughness is a hard barrier to cross in this cube, as there aren't a lot of things that will trade in combat and it outlives most burn spells as well. This card is an aggro killer. [[Auger of Autumn]] might be a better option here, especially now that I've chopped [[Setessan Champion]] for being too narrow.

[[Marshal's Anthem]] continues to outperform my expectations in these types of decks. 6-mana to bring back Titania is a bargain considering her ETB and the added anthem effect. It does make me wonder how much "big stuff" reanimator I want to support. [[Helping Hand]] is a white graveyard interaction piece that is more to my personal taste. It's cheap, has limited targets, and can be recurred with things like [[Snapcaster Mage]] and [[Dreadhorde Arcanist]], which I find to be much more interesting ways to leverage the graveyard.

###  2-1 {r}{g} midrange/control with [[Gruff Triplets]] win condition

This deck won by playing a game of attrition, burning out early game threats long enough to cast [[Gruff Triplets]]. It was vulnerable if you managed to stick some aggressive threats, but you definitely had to win fast. In that regard, I really liked how this Gruul deck played more like a control deck with [[Gruff Triplets]] as the finisher.

Gruff triplets is such a swingy card. I had said several drafts ago that I was going to replace this one, and I still think I will. The problem I have with [[Gruff Triplets]] is that he's a win-in-a-can. You can go from no board presence, 5 life, to winning in two turns with very little that can be done about it unless your opponent has the perfect hand (board wipe, or several bounce / flicker spells and a removal spell). I have my eyes on [[Esika's Chariot]] as one potential replacement. I think my green finishers need to have some value in the face of removal, but [[Gruff Triplets]] might go too far. I do really like that it is a strong green top-end that is resilient in the face of removal without resorting to _hexproof_ or _shroud_ or any uninteractive mechanics. But the raw power level in this cube might as well be uninteractive in many matchups.

I really enjoy [[Domri, Anarch of Boals]] as a planeswalker that doesn't build infinite value, and that doesn't have an ultimate "Win the game" button at the end. He does very relevant things - ramp, mana fixing, an anthem, and removal. The only issue I take with him is the uncounterability. I won't argue that this isn't powerful, or isn't relevant. However, I think it comes with a gameplay problem of negating large swaths of the cube's interaction. This is one to keep an eye on - I really wish he just didn't have that clause. There are other planeswalkers who meet this criteria - [[Wrenn and Six]] in particular is even in the same colors. I think Domri is probably OK so long as I continue to keep the number of nonland permanent bounce spells in blue high, as they at least give a way to deal with it in a color that otherwise is creature-light (so can't attack planeswalkers easily) and relies on counterspells for interaction.

I'd also like to call out [[Blazing Rootwalla]] here. He's just a lil guy, but even in his first draft he's shown himself capable of being a real pain. The threat of activation is real, and I've seen him actually get cast using his _madness_ cost a few times already. I think he fits in nicely.

###  2-1 {w}{r}{b}{u} with [[Mayhem Devil]] and [[Goblin Bombardment]]

This deck was also a bit slow to get started, but once the engine came online it was really hard to beat. [[Goblin Bombardment]] is such a cool card and totally warps the game. This deck wasn't huge on token production, but managed to leverage ETB and LTB abilities to its advantage when sacrificing creatures. [[Revillark]] was awesome here, and justified its presence in the cube for sure. I also really liked seeing [[Goblin Bombardment]] used in a more "fair" way, rather than generating a dozen tokens and sacrificing them all at once for lethal - I'd like to make sure this type of deck is by far the more common build of the two. Speaking of which... the only loss here was against the [[Parallel Lives]] token deck, which also trended towards the late game but managed to go just a bit bigger when it got there.

###  2-1 {b}{r}{g} [[Parallel Lives]] tokens

There are some pretty insane plays that can be made regarding tokens. This time, I was lucky enough to witness a [[Chandra, Hope's Beacon]] helping pay for a [[Parallel Lives]] --> [[Empty the Warrens]] and it was glorious. A bit more of a swingy play than I really want to run rampant in this cube, but also pretty cool that it might happen sometimes. It does feel a little bit like [[Parallel Lives]] doesn't fit the mold of the rest of the cube, but maybe that's an OK thing. This is one to keep an eye on though - if it turns out there are no real ways to interact with this strategy then it will need tuning. I mentioned it earlier, but [[Engineered Explosives]] seems like a slam dunk option for interacting with these strategies.

[[Wilderness Reclamation]] proved to be fairly useful even in a deck with a limited number of instant speed options. I still think this really requires a harder build around to really shine, but it was very cool seeing it come out with [[Vivien, Champion of the Wilds]]. Neither of these cards get picked often, but I still really like them for the way they can totally change your game plan.

[[Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin]] is also worth calling out. There are plenty of good ways to buff his power now, making him a fun build around piece with a really high ceiling. I have found that if you can buff his power, he's very hard to deal with. Otherwise, he might be a total dud if your opponent has a good blocker.

###  1-2 {b}{r} aggro

This was my deck. The main failing of this deck was a lack of reach and a lack of creature removal to clear the path for my attackers. The [[Gruff Triplets]] deck scopped up the vast majority of the burn spells before I did, leaving me pretty vulnerable to defensive creatures. I did manage to score a win off the back of [[Comet Storm]], which was great, but there were several times where a [[Lightning Bolt]] or [[Burst Lightning]] would have made the game for me. I do think red / black could use a bit more evasion, so planning on looking at _menace_ particularly in black to help shore up this gap. Largely I think this was a deckbuilding failure rather than a problem with the cube's card pool, though.

[[Tectonic Reformation]] was a new addition this draft, and I think it performed OK. It's a bit slow for an aggro deck, but it does manage to accrue a LOT of value if your mana curve is sufficiently low. I managed to cycle 5 lands on it easily some games, which kept my aggressive deck fed with threats. I think this one still needs some time to soak though before I decide if it's a good fit. There were definitely times I felt I'd rather not have drawn it, even with the _cycling_ mode on it.

###  1-2 {w}{b} tokens / vampires

[[Adanto Vanguard]] was awesome. The threat of activation to make it indestructable poses some serious decicions for both players. Paying 4 life to destroy a blocker is pretty good value, right up until it isn't. In some ways this acted like a watered down [[Dark Confidant]], trading life for card advantage.

This deck threated to win a game droughted on 2-mana off the back of [[Throne of the God-Pharoh]], which is another card that always over performs. As an artifact, it's a threat that's a bit hard to interact with. The downside of course is that you need creatures to tap with in order to get any value from it at all.

[[Goldenglow Moth]] is a personal favorite from the first ever deck I constructed long, long ago. But he feels bad in this cube, so he's coming out. He doesn't really progress any strategy, just prolongs games in a somewhat groan-worthy way.

[[Fearless Fledgling]] put in a lot of work when it came out. It can get big pretty quickly, and there aren't a ton of fliers floating around. Without removal, you're probably in trouble.

[[Puppeteer Clique]] occasionally felt bad - there were some games where there weren't great targets in the opponent's graveyard.

[[Liliana, Death's Majesty]] was valuable, although a bit slow and wasn't enough on her own to overcome the {b}{g} midrange deck who happened to have a [[Vampire Hexmage]] at the ready.

###  1-2 {b}{g} [[Tarmogoyf]] midrange deck

This deck was a classic Norris midrange pile. It had the goyf, it had the pig, it had [[Quest for the Gemblades]], and it had zero nonbasic lands.

[[Tarmogoyf]] continues to be great. He's pretty much always a big/big, while also being quite fair - no trample means he can be chump blocked forever. He outgrows a number of removal spells pretty quickly (e.g., [[Disfigure]]), while also being forever vulnerable to others ([[Prismatic Ending]]). He provides a unique threat, without being the scariest thing in the cube by a long shot.

The group hasn't really bit on [[Duress]] too much in the past, but it did some real work this time around. Even the fail case of simply viewing your opponent's hand is pretty solid, and there are a lot of non-creature, non-land threats that need to be dealt with. It always provided value and interesting decisions, and reinforced my confidence in the amount of hand interaction I've added in recent updates.

My distaste for protecion / hexproof / etc. continues to grow, and [[Vines of Vastwood]] is a casualty of that. It's certainly powerful and quite swingy when it is played, but I just don't enjoy the game play patterns.

[[Archfiend of Ifnir]] was surprisingly a bit of a dud here from the games I witnessed. Definitely strong, but it was usually dealt with pretty handily. Across all the times this has been played, I think the cycling triggered ability has only been relevant once or twice. My opinion of this card in this cube is falling pretty fast the longer it goes without that mode being relevant, as a 5-mana 5/4 flier is otherwise pretty boring.

###  0-3 {w}{u} control

Feels like this deck is just a step behind where it needs to be. Have seen it in a few drafts now. I think there are three main issues here:

- White's removal is either expensive (e.g., [[Oblivion Ring]]), sorcery speed (e.g., [[Oblivion Ring]]), or can be dealt with (e.g., [[Oblivion Ring]]). This deck probably wants cheaper, instant speed removal.
- The win conditions available for it are a bit underwhelming.
    - [[Thing in the Ice]] is great, but of course requires building around and doesn't trigger off [[Oblivion Ring]] variants. You really want to load up on instants and sorceries here.
    - [[Curator of Mysteries]] is solid, and probably not going anywhere, but is also a bit underwhelming as a payoff for being on the back foot all game.
    - [[Angel of Salvation]] is expensive and relies on creatures being on the field in order to reduce the cost. I think she's great, but not meant for this deck.
    - [[Sphinx of Lost Truths]] is less of a win condition and more of a body attached to a mediocre dig spell.
- It's hard to turn the corner. Right now, it relies almost entirely on a board wipe of some kind. Otherwise, it's just landing and sticking a finisher, but as discussed those are a bit sad at the moment.

I've already made a few changes that will boost this one.

- [[Gitaxian Probe]] goes in any deck, but I think will do especially well as a free [[Thing in the Ice]] trigger that also provides hand information.
- New white removal spells - [[Elspeth's Smite]], [[Soul Parition]], and [[Unexpectedly Absent]] are all new instant speed options in white.
- [[Monastery Mentor]] comes in as a new flavor of win condition that's a bit more aggressive.
- [[Mystic Sanctuary]] to pull back a bounce spell or counterspell for free proved very valuable in testing.

I have a few other things up my sleeve for a potential future update:

- [[Ethereal Forager]] was fun in testing and can provide a lot of card advantage. It's vulnerable, but can be protected with counterspells, etc., for a good time.
- [[Mystic Confluence]] is perhaps too strong, but is also on my watch list as a card that will help this deck "turn the corner" so to speak, and just generally draw folks into blue (another problem I am fighting with).
- [[Shark Typhoon]] is a modal win condition that can be played at just about any point of the game, meaning you have more flexibility in deciding when it is time to "turn the corner".
- [[Soul Snare]] is another removal option for this deck. Perhaps less good since it's still enchantment based, but plays nicely with [[Tameshi, Reality Architect]]. And the fact that it's only {w} to cast means it's hard to lose tempo on this one.
- [[Vendilion Clique]] is another one that might be too strong, but provides a more proactive slant.
- [[Celestial Colonnade]] is another classic win condition that's hard to interact with.

I think all of these together would supercharge this deck, so I'm going to hold off to see how the changes I've already made perform before deciding what else is needed.
