## TL;DR

Aggro / midrange / control feel pretty even right now! Each draft seems to have a different strategy rise to the top. Only minor adjustments needed.

- Does the cube really need both [[Snapcaster]] and [[Halo Forager]]? I think I would like one [[Snapcaster]], and then something more diverse for the other slot.
- [[Soul Warden]] makes games drag out. It's plenty powerful, but I don't want cards that don't progress the game in some way.
- [[Panharmonicon]] is still very strong, perhaps stronger than it ever was. I think I will swap it for [[Virtue of Knowledge]] for the fun landfall synergies (surveil, [[Field of the Dead]], etc.) and the extra mana to play it.
- {b}{r} aggro might have too many signpost cards, or maybe we just have a couple of players who have a tendency to play it...
- Hand interaction is awesome.
- [[Satyr Wayfinder]] and [[Mire Triton]] are the last self-mill cards in the cube, and I don't trust them to not mill my good stuff into the graveyard. So they are probably coming out.

## {w}{b} "Squeeze" (2-1)

I built this deck primarily around an early [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]]. It's meant to be fairly aggressive, while also squeezing your opponent with creature-based removal and hand interaction. It struggled a bit against the really low to the ground aggressive decks, but I think a slightly better version of it would stood a better chance. I think I could use one more really solid taxing creature that either acts as removal (in the mold of [[Werefox Bodyguard]]) or splash red for something like [[Cemetery Gatekeeper]], which is what I wanted to do but I never found the right cards.

I think it's worth calling out:

- [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]] felt great. Not too oppressive, but definitely powerful.
- [[Tidehollow Sculler]], [[Kitesail Freebooter]], and other hand-hate was awesome. It didn't always win me the game, but it went a long way towards it and helped make this deck play in a unique way comparatively.
- [[Agonizing Remorse]] in particular is great because of its late-game relevance.
- [[Faerie Guidemother // Gift of the Fae]] was great, and felt better as a late-game draw than an early game flier.
- [[Helping Hand]] was solid as well. The tapped ETB was noticeably painful at times, but I was still happy to have it. Pulling back [[Werefox Bodyguard]] was a delight.
- [[The Wandering Emperor]] is so fun to play with. She no longer feels like so much of a power outlier these days and seems more balanced, which is also nice as it means the strategic choices that she provides are more relevant.
- [[Unexpectedly Absent]] was surprisingly good even for the base {w}{w} with {x}={0}. Simply removing a blocker for a turn, or nulling out hard-earned counters was super valuable in this more aggressive build.
- [[Cling to Dust]] played perfectly fine. Every time I drew it, I had something to do with it, and occasionally it was even relevant as graveyard hate (but it didn't need to be in order for me to feel OK mainboarding it). At it's floor, it's just a fine way to spend an extra mana that would otherwise go to waste, and gives you a choice of more gas or more runway depending on what you need. A handful of games I got to cast it twice, meaning it becomes card advantage instead of card selection. Would likely be even better in a deck with some spells-matter payoffs.

The way the hand interaction played out really made me want to double down - it was a strong, interesting to play, and unique strategy. It's possible something like [[Inquisition of Kozilek]] or even [[Thoughtsieze]] could make an appearance in the future.

## {w}{b}{g} +1/+1 counters and lands midrange (2-1)

This deck went pretty large as far as decks go in this cube, but still managed to have early game presence. I think it was quite powerful. It handily dealt with one of the {b}{r} aggro decks, and held its own pretty well against another rather big {u}{b} control deck with [[Panharmonicon]], but ultimately succumbed to the overwhelming weight of having [[Hostage Taker]] cast against you twice in one game.

- [[Warden of the Inner Sky]] is fantastic in conjunction with food and other trinket token makers. It allows you to get the benefits of the tap ability without sacrificing your ability to attack. [[Gilded Goose]], [[Greta, Sweettooth Scourge]], and [[Tireless Tracker]] being examples of cards that pair exceptionally well (as will [[Thraben Inspector]] when he appears in a future update).
- [[Courser of Kruphix]] is also very strong and provides green with much-needed card advantage.
- [[Roaring Earth]] is another that is sneaky good. It's hard to interact with, and it plays really well with fetch lands.
- [[Cankerbloom]] is great but even with so many counters flying around, the _proliferate_ is almost never the mode you want to pick. Sort of a bummer.
- I like [[Sevinne's Reclamation]] more each time I see it. Pulling back two fetch lands in a deck with abundant _landfall_ triggers is a totally valid use for it here.
- [[Pollenbright Druid]] always managed to do something, but is pretty mediocre still. The ceiling seems to be helping [[Warden of the Inner Sky]], and I think there are probably better options for that.
- [[Horizon Canopy]] can be painful, but the ability to sacrifice for a card late game is really really good even in "big" decks like this one. Very convinced on keeping the horizon lands at this point.
- [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] may be the most threatening creature in the cube at this point. This deck got her out with [[Parallel Lives]] and it was a real problem.

## {u}{b} flicker control

This deck leaned into [[Panharmonicon]]. It's been a while since we've seen a deck built like this, but when it shows up it's very strong.

Key cards included:

- [[Hostage Taker]], who is so brutal when the ETB is doubled up. Even managed to steal and deal with a resolved [[Gruff Triplets]].
- [[Soul Warden]], who was just oppressive and will likely finally be coming out of the cube. I was already eyeing this one for being a feels-bad card, but it probably generated 30+ life across two games and so I feel confident in removing it now.
- [[Panharmonicon]], which is often looked over in drafts but has a lot of potential clearly.
- [[Halo Forager]] and [[Snapcaster Mage]], which allowed for awesome graveyard shenanigans like flashing back [[Wrath of God]] and [[Unearth]] in the same turn.

## {b}{r} aggro (2-1 and )

There were two of these that showed up this time. This also isn't the first time this has happened, so I do wonder if this archetype might be over-supported or at least over-signaled. Both decks seemed to do fairly well, although one ended up being less aggressive than originally intended. One knob I am considering is cutting down on the number of black "can't block" creatures, as these are mostly unwanted by midrange and control strategies, and I currently have quite a few. I'll be looking for cards that play nicely in more than on strategy, while also working in an aggressive deck. I've got my eye on [[Bloodsky Berserker]] as an option that's aggressive, but I think could also see play in control and (to an extent) midrange decks.

Notable cards:

- [[Anje's Ravager]] finally saw play and was very strong. It's also just a very fun card, providing a bit of a gamble, a lot of card advantage, and some interesting strategic decisions on both sides. It rarely came out on turn three though, since the deck that had it wasn't able to empty its hand quick enough for it to feel worth it. I suspect we haven't yet witnessed it at its best, and I am a little bit afraid as a result.
- [[Seasoned Pyromancer]] was also very good, creating three bodies was very relevant in my matchup.
- [[Fire // Ice]] saw it's first play time here, and was fine as expected.
- [[Gitaxian Probe]] was also played here, which was fun.
- [[Phoenix Chick]] continues to outperform many people's expectations.

## {b}{g} Delirium

Discussing this one, I think the main issue was that it was lacking some focus - it used 3 slots for ramp spells that probably would have better been used on removal or some more beef.

- [[Inexorable Blob]] was the real standout here - it's incredibly scary when it manages to attack with _delirium_. Certainly requires a bit of building around, but it adds up in damage quickly.
- [[Quest for the Gravelord]] always does better than I give it credit for. It may be a bit slow in some decks, but a 5/5 for 1 mana can be quite troublesome.
- [[Satyr Wayfinder]] is always underwhelming. Even in this deck which ostensibly wants cards in the yard, it feels bad to mill your gas. I think this needs to become [[Deeproot Wayfinder]] instead - a bit more pricey, but a might higher floor and I think more interesting gameplay decisions as well. Deeproot should also fit into a wider variety of decks than Satyr.
- [[Cunning Lethemancer]] made an appearance, but didn't get a ton of playing time. He looked interesting for the couple of turns he was alive.

## {w}{u}{b}{r}{g} Spells and lands (0-3)

This deck was gunning for the "Win a match with no basic lands" achievement. And while it didn't succeed in that regard, it was a very cool deck and was still pretty competitive.

Some learnings:

- It's probably viable to make a deck like this, although this one ended up doing a fair bit of losing, most of the games were legitimately competitive and interesting.
- The mana base is painful, or slow, or both, so decks that go this direction need to be prepared for that with lots of ways to delay the game, pushing them pretty hard into controlling strategies.
- [[Field of the Dead]] is a scary card. I don't think it was showcased especially well here since there wasn't any sort of ramp or other landfall synergies, but it still is scary seeing it come out.
- [[Murderous Cut]] played pretty well the time I saw it. A one mana "Destroy target creature" was totally achievable.
- [[Ethereal Forager]] is a huge target, and eats removal most of the time. But, if it sticks it's pretty strong. Even if it doesn't stick, a 3/3 flier for {u}{u} is pretty reasonable and even thought it can be case cheaply, its expensive mana value means it dodges removal like [[Glass Casket]] that threats like [[Tarmogoyf]] wouldn't.
- [[Empty the Warrens]] is still good. I am not sure how much I like the board states that come from it though - they can be pretty tough to navigate and can slow down the game. Need to think about this one. It's a unique card (the only one with storm) which is both a positive in terms of diverse win conditions, and a negative in terms of keyword complexity. I am of two minds about it right now.

## {w}{u} control/spells (0-1)

Lost against the midrage deck, although got mana screwed in the second game and was almost able to stabilize in the first.

Of note:

- [[Thing in the Ice]] is still very fun, but it does often take a while to flip. Even so, considering there are only 6 creatures in the cube with power >3, the 4 toughness on Thing is very relevant in slower control decks.
