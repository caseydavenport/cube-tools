Discussing this one, I think the main issue was that it was lacking some focus - it used 3 slots for ramp spells that probably would have better been used on removal or some more beef.

- [[Inexorable Blob]] was the real standout here - it's incredibly scary when it manages to attack with _delirium_. Certainly requires a bit of building around, but it adds up in damage quickly.
- [[Quest for the Gravelord]] always does better than I give it credit for. It may be a bit slow in some decks, but a 5/5 for 1 mana can be quite troublesome.
- [[Satyr Wayfinder]] is always underwhelming. Even in this deck which ostensibly wants cards in the yard, it feels bad to mill your gas. I think this needs to become [[Deeproot Wayfinder]] instead - a bit more pricey, but a might higher floor and I think more interesting gameplay decisions as well. Deeproot should also fit into a wider variety of decks than Satyr.
- [[Cunning Lethemancer]] made an appearance, but didn't get a ton of playing time. He looked interesting for the couple of turns he was alive.
