I built this deck primarily around an early [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]]. It's meant to be fairly aggressive, while also squeezing your opponent with creature-based removal and hand interaction. It struggled a bit against the really low to the ground aggressive decks, but I think a slightly better version of it would stood a better chance. I think I could use one more really solid taxing creature that either acts as removal (in the mold of [[Werefox Bodyguard]]) or splash red for something like [[Cemetery Gatekeeper]], which is what I wanted to do but I never found the right cards.

I think it's worth calling out:

- [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]] felt great. Not too oppressive, but definitely powerful.
- [[Tidehollow Sculler]], [[Kitesail Freebooter]], and other hand-hate was awesome. It didn't always win me the game, but it went a long way towards it and helped make this deck play in a unique way comparatively.
- [[Agonizing Remorse]] in particular is great because of its late-game relevance.
- [[Faerie Guidemother // Gift of the Fae]] was great, and felt better as a late-game draw than an early game flier.
- [[Helping Hand]] was solid as well. The tapped ETB was noticeably painful at times, but I was still happy to have it. Pulling back [[Werefox Bodyguard]] was a delight.
- [[The Wandering Emperor]] is so fun to play with. She no longer feels like so much of a power outlier these days and seems more balanced, which is also nice as it means the strategic choices that she provides are more relevant.
- [[Unexpectedly Absent]] was surprisingly good even for the base {w}{w} with {x}={0}. Simply removing a blocker for a turn, or nulling out hard-earned counters was super valuable in this more aggressive build.
- [[Cling to Dust]] played perfectly fine. Every time I drew it, I had something to do with it, and occasionally it was even relevant as graveyard hate (but it didn't need to be in order for me to feel OK mainboarding it). At it's floor, it's just a fine way to spend an extra mana that would otherwise go to waste, and gives you a choice of more gas or more runway depending on what you need. A handful of games I got to cast it twice, meaning it becomes card advantage instead of card selection. Would likely be even better in a deck with some spells-matter payoffs.

The way the hand interaction played out really made me want to double down - it was a strong, interesting to play, and unique strategy. It's possible something like [[Inquisition of Kozilek]] or even [[Thoughtsieze]] could make an appearance in the future.
