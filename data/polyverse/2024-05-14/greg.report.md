This deck leaned into [[Panharmonicon]]. It's been a while since we've seen a deck built like this, but when it shows up it's very strong.

Key cards included:

- [[Hostage Taker]], who is so brutal when the ETB is doubled up. Even managed to steal and deal with a resolved [[Gruff Triplets]].
- [[Soul Warden]], who was just oppressive and will likely finally be coming out of the cube. I was already eyeing this one for being a feels-bad card, but it probably generated 30+ life across two games and so I feel confident in removing it now.
- [[Panharmonicon]], which is often looked over in drafts but has a lot of potential clearly.
- [[Halo Forager]] and [[Snapcaster Mage]], which allowed for awesome graveyard shenanigans like flashing back [[Wrath of God]] and [[Unearth]] in the same turn.
