This deck was gunning for the "Win a match with no basic lands" achievement. And while it didn't succeed in that regard, it was a very cool deck and was still pretty competitive.

Some learnings:

- It's probably viable to make a deck like this, although this one ended up doing a fair bit of losing, most of the games were legitimately competitive and interesting.
- The mana base is painful, or slow, or both, so decks that go this direction need to be prepared for that with lots of ways to delay the game, pushing them pretty hard into controlling strategies.
- [[Field of the Dead]] is a scary card. I don't think it was showcased especially well here since there wasn't any sort of ramp or other landfall synergies, but it still is scary seeing it come out.
- [[Murderous Cut]] played pretty well the time I saw it. A one mana "Destroy target creature" was totally achievable.
- [[Ethereal Forager]] is a huge target, and eats removal most of the time. But, if it sticks it's pretty strong. Even if it doesn't stick, a 3/3 flier for {u}{u} is pretty reasonable and even thought it can be case cheaply, its expensive mana value means it dodges removal like [[Glass Casket]] that threats like [[Tarmogoyf]] wouldn't.
- [[Empty the Warrens]] is still good. I am not sure how much I like the board states that come from it though - they can be pretty tough to navigate and can slow down the game. Need to think about this one. It's a unique card (the only one with storm) which is both a positive in terms of diverse win conditions, and a negative in terms of keyword complexity. I am of two minds about it right now.
