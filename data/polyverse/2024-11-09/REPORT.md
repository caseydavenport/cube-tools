## TL;DR

- Cube continues to be in a pretty good place.
  - Games get started quickly, and decisions feel important.
  - Diverse strategies continue to show up. Good mix of aggro / control / midrange.
- {u}{b} control might be slightly over performing. Need to keep an eye on it.

## {u}{b} control (3-0)

This was my deck. It's about as close to the prototypical Dimir control deck as I could get it. It comes with a ton of removal, counterspells, and a small handful of hard to interact with threats. It ended up going 3-0, but I wouldn't say comfortably. Regardless, I think this is a really solid piece of evidence that very hard, draw-go control decks are viable in this cube. Each of my matches was won two games to one, and while some games I felt decisively in control, most felt pretty close.

This was the first time a number of cards saw play:

- This was the first time [[Urza's Saga]] had been drafted in the cube. It was not a deck that could really break it, and yet it still proved quite valuable. Playing it wasn't always an obvious choice, as it costs a land drop and a commitment to invest further mana in future turns. But the card advantage was a great fit for a control deck like this - allowing me to spend mana without spending cards helped me maximize my resources for the late game.
- [[Rishadan Port]] filled a similar role here - it allowed me to expend mana without expending cards. It was _very_ strong in some situations, like punishing greedier 4 and 5 color decks and delaying creature lands.
- [[Toxic Deluge]] was great as expected. The life loss cost is definitely a real consideration in this environment, though.
- [[Accursed Marauder]] was quietly quite solid. I managed to bring it back a few times with [[Virtue of Persistence]] which was great.
- [[Bloodsky Berserker]] was super fan, and quite strong. It really encourages you to think more carefully about when you're casting your spells, and pays you off handsomely for it.

Other notable call outs:

- [[Treasure Cruise]] is so exceptionally good in decks like this. I just [[Ponder]] and [[Preordain]]ed my way through my deck, and had plenty of fuel for what was almost always a late game [[Ancestral Recall]]. If I was able to cast it, it was almost a guaranteed win. Cards like [[Ephara's Dispersal]] also helped get there quicker.
- [[Murderous Cut]] was similarly good. I often found myself with enough in my graveyard to cast both of these delve cards for their minimum cost, which is super efficient.
- [[Shark Typhoon]] is a menace. A huge flying shark protected by counterspells is hard to contend with.
- [[Languish]] won me a few games as well. Although there were a couple of times that the fact it wasn't [[Damnation]] was very relevant.

Overall, the deck was really fun to play and felt very strong. {U}{B} control decks have been performing very strongly in this cube for some time now, so I may actually need to start thinking about how to temper their success a smidge if the meta doesn't rebalance itself in the next few drafts. If anything, this makes me feel like I can start adding some more fun aggro cards with confidence.

## {w}{u}{b} control / discard (2-X)

This was the second strong {U}{B} centered control deck in this draft. It's not common for two decks playing largely in the same space to be this successful in the same draft, so something to keep an eye on. Compared to my deck, this was a more balanced approach, running a larger number of creatures with spell slinging and graveyard interaction synergies.

First timers:

- [[Psychic Frog]] is a monster. Exceptionally strong, and potentially environment warping. If you know this is out there, you need to really prioritize hard removal. I worry about the effect this card will have on the viability of red aggressive decks with primarily burn based removal. Time will tell. On the plus side, some cool discard / graveyard synergies really came through while this guy was on the field, even though he probably would have taken over the game without them.
- [[Liliana of the Veil]]
- [[Soul Partition]]
- [[Cling to Dust]] was solid in the games I witnessed. This deck had lots of ways to recur it even without the _escape_ mode.
- [[Stalactite Stalker]]

Noteworthy:

- [[Ethereal Forager]] has come down a fair number of times now, and is almost always instantly removed. It's a fairly strong card, so I suppose I can see why. I think the appeal of "sinking" your opponents delve cost makes this one highly attractive for removal spells, even when other potentially stronger immediate threats might exist. When it did stick, it was quite strong, providing lots of flexibility and card advantage.

## {w}{r} aggro

I was happy to see a Boros aggro deck show up this time. Typically Rakdos has dominated the aggro scene in previous drafts.  This deck was perhaps a little bit lighter on 1-drop creatures than I would have expected for a pure aggro deck, but did well. All three of my games against it were down to the wire, and could have gone either way based on draws.

First timers:

- [[March of Otherworldly Light]]
- [[Warleader's Call]]. An extra power + toughness means a good deal in this environment. The added reach late game via pinging your opponent was also very welcome here.

Noteworthy:

- [[Goblin Bombardment]] is very good. It makes removal spells feel bad and it provides much needed late-game reach. Might want a tiny bit more in the way of enchantment removal, but not much needed here.
- [[Welcoming Vampire]] is a must-kill. Can easily be an extra card each turn, especially with repeatable token generation like [[Adanto, the First Fort]].
- [[The Wandering Emperor]] used to be on my "almost too strong" list, but recently has felt exceptionally fair. Still very powerful, and super fun to play with and against. I want more Planeswalkers like this.
- [[Sevinne's Reclamation]] and [[Helping Hand]] have been very solid. There are a lot of good targets for them in this environment.

## {w}{u}{b}{g} control-ish (0-3)

This deck came together as a bit of a pile. The main problem with this deck was its lack of things to do in the early game. It was often very far behind by the time it managed to cast its 5 and 6 drops.

First timers:

- [[Phelia, Exuberand Shepherd]] only came down once that I saw, and played exactly like how I expected. Pretty strong, and the lack of evasion meant that it was usually for nullifying a blocker.
- [[Thoughtseize]] is good stuff.

Noteworthy:

- [[Gruff Triplets]] is still strong, but this deck showed that casting it on turn 6 with no other support isn't a winning strategy.
- [[Goldmeadow Harrier]] saw some play, which was nice. I think this card is often undervalued, and played pretty well here.
- [[Puppeteer Clique]] also saw some good action, which was nice. I have been on the verge of cutting it due to underperformance, but this gives it a bit more runway for now.
- [[Beast Within]] has gotten a lot worse. A 3/3 is a fairly threatening body nowadays. There are still times where you'd prefer a 3/3 with no abilities, but for 3 mana it never really feels good. This one will probably be cut.

## {w}{u}{b}{r}{g} 5-color lands / midrange (1-2)

All 5 colors! Drafted [[Golos, Tireless Pilgrim]] but then didn't play it, which made me a bit sad. The deck actually played pretty well, despite going 1-2. It almost always had the mana it needed, reaching all 5 colors by its 5th land drop. It had some nice synergies show up as well.

First timers:

- [[Steppe Lynx]] the only time I saw it, it was removed right away. Could imagine it being scary though.
- [[Thraben Inspector]] - not much of note here. A solid one drop, but nothing too exciting.
- [[Scalding Viper]] played pretty nicely. [[Steam Clean]] is super useful, and the "tax" on cheap spells was pretty effective too. The body is a bit underwhelming.
- [[Brainsurge]] seemed to play well in this deck.

Noteworthy:

- [[Scryb Ranger]] provided some very cool and unique gameplay.  I don't love the protection from blue, but for now am willing to let it slide due to the synergies and decisions this card provides in game. Especially late game, when lands on the field are perhaps less important, this allowed pseudo-vigilance, while also fueling landfall synergies with cards like [[Fearless Fledgling]].
- [[Tamiyo, Compleated Sage]]. Planeswalkers are kind of just good. This one seems pretty bland at first glance, but the ability to repeatedly tap down a threat is just solid, and the "reanimation" mode was also quite powerful when used. The main problem with this one is that it feels kinda boring if you can't turn the corner and start reanimating things. Will keep an eye on it.
- [[Reveillark]] - don't bounce this boy. It's "leaves the battlefield", not dies.

##  {u}{r} aggro-control / spells-matter

Signaled by [[Irencrag Pyromancer]], this deck played well but often found itself in the unlucky position of having only one-half of its synergy pieces. i.e., a bunch of [[Opt]] with no [[Faerie Vandal]]'s and vice-versa. I suspect part of this is just luck, but it's also something to keep an eye on.

First timers:

- [[Irencrag Pyromancer]]
- [[Triton Wavebreaker]]

Noteworthy:

- [[Brineborn Cutthroat]] is a card that hasn't shown up much in recent times but actually did some work this time around. Unfortunate it has no evasion, as it was able to just be chump blocked indefinitely.

## {b}{r}{g} midrange / graveyard

First timers:

- [[Dragonsguard Elite]]
- [[Questing Druid]]

Noteworthy:


## {b}{r} aggro

[[Quest for the Gemblades]] over performed in this exclusively {b}{r} deck.
