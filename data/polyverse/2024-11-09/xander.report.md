A more balanced control deck approach, running a number of creatures with spell slinging and graveyard interaction synergies.

First timers:

- [[Psychic Frog]] is a monster. Exceptionally strong, and potentially environment warping. If you know this is out there, you need to really prioritize hard removal. I worry about the effect this card will have on the viability of red aggressive decks with primarily burn based removal. Time will tell. On the plus side, some cool discard / graveyard synergies really came through while this guy was on the field, even though he probably would have taken over the game without them.
- [[Liliana of the Veil]]
- [[Soul Partition]]
- [[Cling to Dust]] was solid in the games I witnessed. This deck had lots of ways to recur it even without the _escape_ mode.
- [[Stalactite Stalker]]

Noteworthy:

- [[Ethereal Forager]] has come down a fair number of times now, and is almost always instantly removed. It's a fairly strong card, so I suppose I can see why. I think the appeal of "sinking" your opponents delve cost makes this one highly attractive for removal spells, even when other potentially stronger immediate threats might exist. When it did stick, it was quite strong, providing lots of flexibility and card advantage.
