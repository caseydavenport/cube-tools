This was a midrange / lands deck with a fair bit of synergy. I got into it with an early [[Primeval Titan]], but sadly never got to cast it (nor did I draft the lands package I wanted to go with it!)

The real standouts here:

- [[Liliana of the Veil]] was great. Powerful and also fun to play with. Strong, synergistic, and allowed for skill expression. A+.
- [[Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd]] was also quite strong. Less fun that Liliana, but still pretty fun. Flickering tokens was especially effective, as was flicker planeswalkers to refill their loyalty counters.
- [[Engineered Explosives]] was especially devastating, as Dom was playing a tokens deck with [[Parallel Lives]]. I knocked out 10+ tokens at once.
- [[Fearless Fledgling]] continues to be very effective. Perhaps not to _most_ fun, but still fine. A flying is a good keyword, even if it's temporary.
