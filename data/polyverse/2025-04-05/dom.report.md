I think this deck largely got unlucky - it rarely (if ever) drew its removal when it needed it.

It was still able to crank out a bunch of tokens with [[Parallel Lives]], [[Young Pyromancer]], and [[Saheeli, Sublime Artificer]].

Other notes:

- [[Rielle, the Everwise]] was _fine_, but not super. Dom said he would probably cut for another cantrip in this deck instead.
- [[Dreamtide Whale]] never came down, but Dom also said he would probably prefer another spell. Take with a grain of salt since it never actually saw play time.
- [[Into the Roil]] and [[Aether Tradewinds]] are a bit expensive in this type of deck. Still were fairly useful though.
