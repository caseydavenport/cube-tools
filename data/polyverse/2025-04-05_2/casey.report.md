Only played one game, but it didn't go super well for me. I made an early mistake which cost me this one. Namely, I tried to remove a [[Tarmogoyf]] and failed to see that my removal spell would buff it. I ended up losing [[Esper Sentinel]] in the aftermath, which even further buffed the 'Goyf. I eventually stabilized, but it cost me a lot to do so.

- [[Esper Sentinel]] felt really good until I needlessly threw it away.
- [[Lost Jitte]] was a bit underwhelming, but it came out once the game was already effectively lost to hard to say too much.
- [[Harm's Way]] is what lost me this one. It's a nifty trick sometimes, but this felt pretty bad.
