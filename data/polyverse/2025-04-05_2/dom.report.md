This deck ended up totally popping off once it got its key pieces in place. Took it a bit of time, but it was a house when it did.

- [[Sylvan Library]] was very, very strong. We'll see how this performs in less synergistic decks, and how often this comes together. But it felt neigh unbeatable once it was down.
- [[Treasure Cruise]] continues to be very strong. It takes a bit more work to line it up, so I still feel pretty good about this.
- [[Faerie Vandal]] really got to shine with [[Sylvan Library]] in play!
- As did [[Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse]]. Was very happy to see this.
- [[Lotus Cobra]] continues to be a favorite.
- [[Tireless Tracker]] continues to be threatning, but fairly easily dealt with.
- [[Collected Company]] totally whiffed. This was probably not the deck for it, with only 10 creatures, but still something to keep an eye on.
