My deck was not good. I tried to build a Tameshi deck to see if I could test it out, but I only picked up Tameshi in the second pack and I feel like I was making the wrong choices in the draft in order to pick cards that worked best with Tameshi. Not very promising to start.

I lost every game. Most were not very close, and primarily came down to me not having any ability to put any pressure on my opponent, or to deal with what they were throwing at me.  Part of that was two turn-1 Mother of Runes, nulling my ability to use any of my removal. But I don't think it can all be chalked up to that.

Let's talk through some cards:

- Steppe Lynx: Was fine when I had land drops, and felt so bad when I ran dry.
- Enlightened Tutor: I had nothing really worth grabbing with it. Felt pretty bad.
- Iron Apprentice: a 1/1 for 1 is still bad, even with a small upside. Many time it was removed and I had no board to put the counter on.
- Urza's Saga is strong, but my deck still managed to make it bad somehow.

I ended up casting Tameshi twice, in the last two games. Whenever he came down, it was cool. The first game, I recurred Iron Apprentice and Tameshi was immediately removed, but it still is some card advantage. Second game I was able to recur Perilous Myr a few times, and it felt great (although I still ended up losing...)

I will note that the other half of my deck - the counters theme revolving around Dreamtide Whale - played great, when it showed up. Double spelling to keep the proliferate engine going was fun, and played well with The Goose Mother and Faerie Vandal.

The final showings were enough for me to consider leaving Tameshi for now - but I need to bump up the supporting cast in a big way. I am hopeful that something like Legion Extruder, and going into red instead of green, would be a better build here. I will give it a few more tries, but it's not looking great for Tameshi here. Removal is too abundant and a 2/3 for 3 is no longer what it once was!
