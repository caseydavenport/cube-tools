Kevin went for a sacrifice build, and his only success came against my pretty unimpressive Tameshi deck. This was a larger build than I usually expect to see for a sacrifice themed build, going into green instead of white as its splash.

He did manage to pull off an infinite combo to finish me off, just in time too! Murderous Redcap + Goblin Bombardment + Renata did me in.

Some other notes:

- Gilded Goose is excellent. Using Esika's Chariot to copy the food was clutch in my game as well.
- The Huntsman's Redemption is great for the mini-overrun, but the second chapter rarely seems like the right thing to do.
- Six is very cool. It was fun in the matchup with my Tameshi deck, as we both had recursion engines we were trying to balance.
