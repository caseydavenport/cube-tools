This deck started out as a control deck, but had to pivot midway through as it was getting cut by the other control players.

It ended up in a graveyard centric midrange build, which was fairly resilient.

It made good use of:

- Tarmogoyf: Did great in the games against me. I didn't really have an answer for it, though.
- Inexorable Blob: Loved seeing this pop out a bunch of slimes. I don't see this card picked much but I think if it can get an attack in it is very good.
- Toxic Deluge: Played great with the big toughness guys like Tarmogoyf. Allowed for breaking symmetry.
- Tamiyo, Compleated Sage: Played great using the -X to pull back cheap things like Mishra's Bauble, and Eternal Witness.
