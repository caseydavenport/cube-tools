This was a solid contender for the 3-0, that came up just a bit short in the finals.

Some good and interesting feedback here:

- Tanner said Crop Rotation is not worth maindecking in this cube, as there aren't enough powerful lands to grab with it. I am not sold on this take, but I think it's cool to hear regardless.
- Call of the Herd wasn't super. I agree that it's pretty middle of the pack here, and that's fine. It's still easy / free card advantage, which is hard to come by.
- Brightglass Gearhulk got its first playing time and some solid positive reviews. I didn't dig too much, but assume it was pulling some of the cheap removal found in this list.
