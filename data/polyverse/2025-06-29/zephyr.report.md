Zephyr got the 3-0 this time with a prime example of an Izzet spells build. Some feedback:

- Izzet spells is so easy to oversupport. In this case, Zephyr passed up a bunch of cantrips and still had plenty to work with in the end. This is something I'm aware of, but not sure yet what (if anything) to do about it.
- Proft's Eidetic Memory was very strong - one of the main win conditions alongside Sprite Dragon and Thing in the Ice.
- One option for trimming down this deck would be to cut some of the more generic burn spells in favor of more situational / synergy driven ones, or to reduce reach by e.g., using more sorcery or creature-only damage spells.
- Counterspells felt good, according to Zephyr. Dropping a threat and protecting it to victory was a common play.
