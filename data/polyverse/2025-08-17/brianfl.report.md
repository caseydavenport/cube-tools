Brian's deck actually has some bangers in it, but I think it was probably just a bit too greedy to see success. I worry that the domain cards will push folks beyond what is tactically sound...

Either way, I am somewhat glad to see that a deck with [[Primevil Titan]], [[Dig Through Time]], [[Wrenn and Six]], [[Sylvan Library]], [[Esika's Chariot]] (i.e., a smattering of very good cards) isn't a shoe-in to win.

I did see [[Woodland Wanderer]] get some play, and it looked cool! So a promising start.
