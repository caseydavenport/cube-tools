This was a fairly basic jund midrange deck, and it did OK. Considering the relative lack of synergy, I am happy with where it ended up.

A few notes:

- [[Deluge of Doom]] was good. This is an excellent card for this environment.
- [[Tarmogoyf]] remains good and cool, all is OK.
- [[Timeline Culler]] was decidedly "meh" in this deck. Not the best place for it maybe? Or maybe just not a great card.
- [[Voracious Hydra]] was great. It didn't feel too strong, but I liked having the optionality.
- [[Liliana, Dreadhorde General]] and [[Rankle, Master of Pranks]] never hit the field.

Overall, I think this deck could have been 2-1 with a little bit better luck and one or two fewer gameplay mistakes.
