James P1P1'd Collected Company and ran with it - drafting a deck that was almost exclusively creatures with very little interaction.

He did splash blue for some games to play [[Man-O-War]] and said he got success in doing so!

This deck did some cool things - like recurring [[Collected Company]] with [[Eternal Witness]] and recurring [[Eternal Witness]] with [[Sevinne's Reclamation]].

Also solid reviews for [[Accursed Marauder]], who continues to justify his presence in the cube.

James recommended [[Reflector Mage]] as an option that would have gone well in his deck - and I largely agree, although Man-O-War is pretty similar and scratches that "classic" itch.
