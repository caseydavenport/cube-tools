A very strong boros aggro deck. This deck did cool stuff as well. Just a couple that I witnessed personally:

- Launching [[Embercleave]] onto [[Heartfire Hero]] for a trigger and power boost.
- Combining [[Clarion Spirit]] with [[Warleader's Call]] for lots of triggers.

Kevin said he enjoyed piloting the deck. I'm glad to see an aggro deck 3-0 for the first time in a while!
