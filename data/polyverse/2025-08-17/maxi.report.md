A few notes:

- Still plenty of ways to tutor for Field of the Dead even without Crop Rotation. So happy I cut that - Traverse is just so much cooler.
- This deck ran lots of removal to help get it to the late game, which was a cool strategy. I had 4-5 threats neutralized in one game I played.
- [[Touch the Spirit Realm]] did some cool things in my game - e.g., flickering impactful tokens for instant-speed interaction.
- [[Kiora, The Rising Tide]] is very cool, and quite achievable.

Maxi noted that activating the man-lands in this deck was often times painful / too costly to go on the offensive, and better left as defensive options.
