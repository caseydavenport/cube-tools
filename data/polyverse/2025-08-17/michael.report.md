Michael went for a dimir control deck, that struggled a little bit. From looking at the list, I would guess it was lacking in early game interaction. It seems to have a fair bit at the top-end in terms of threats / win conditions, but I would guess he was often too far behind by the time the were deployed.

[[Curator of Mysteries]] is sort of a dumb beater. It rarely is relelvant for either of it's cycling abilities. I suspect there is a more fun card I can find here, but for now the Curator is simple, clean, and solid enough.
