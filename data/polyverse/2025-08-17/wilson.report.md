I didn't catch ANY of the games for this one, but I heard it did some cool things like making a copy of Thing in the Ice with Saheeli and having the token insta flip (!!).

This deck has many of the usual suspects, although is missing some of the stronger burn / removal spells. I am happy to see a mid performance here after this deck swept the floor last draft!
