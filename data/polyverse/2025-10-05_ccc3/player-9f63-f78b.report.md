- Goose mother did well. Was cast for 8 at one point off all the ramp!
- Land package worked well.
- Birthing Ritual also played better than expected. Didn't need much to feel worth it.
- Went off a few times with Augur of Autumn and landfall / fetch lands.
- Suggested Oracle of Mul Daya or Icetill Explorer as potential adds.
