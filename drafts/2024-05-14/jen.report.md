This deck went pretty large as far as decks go in this cube, but still managed to have early game presence. I think it was quite powerful. It handily dealt with one of the {b}{r} aggro decks, and held its own pretty well against another rather big {u}{b} control deck with [[Panharmonicon]], but ultimately succumbed to the overwhelming weight of having [[Hostage Taker]] cast against you twice in one game.

- [[Warden of the Inner Sky]] is fantastic in conjunction with food and other trinket token makers. It allows you to get the benefits of the tap ability without sacrificing your ability to attack. [[Gilded Goose]], [[Greta, Sweettooth Scourge]], and [[Tireless Tracker]] being examples of cards that pair exceptionally well (as will [[Thraben Inspector]] when he appears in a future update).
- [[Courser of Kruphix]] is also very strong and provides green with much-needed card advantage.
- [[Roaring Earth]] is another that is sneaky good. It's hard to interact with, and it plays really well with fetch lands.
- [[Cankerbloom]] is great but even with so many counters flying around, the _proliferate_ is almost never the mode you want to pick. Sort of a bummer.
- I like [[Sevinne's Reclamation]] more each time I see it. Pulling back two fetch lands in a deck with abundant _landfall_ triggers is a totally valid use for it here.
- [[Pollenbright Druid]] always managed to do something, but is pretty mediocre still. The ceiling seems to be helping [[Warden of the Inner Sky]], and I think there are probably better options for that.
- [[Horizon Canopy]] can be painful, but the ability to sacrifice for a card late game is really really good even in "big" decks like this one. Very convinced on keeping the horizon lands at this point.
- [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] may be the most threatening creature in the cube at this point. This deck got her out with [[Parallel Lives]] and it was a real problem.
