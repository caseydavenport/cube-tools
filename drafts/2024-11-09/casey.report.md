Ended up going 3-0, but I wouldn't say comforatably. While some games I felt decisively in control, most felt pretty close.

This was the first time a number of cards saw play:

- First time [[Urza's Saga]] had been drafted in the cube. It was not a deck that could really break it, yet it still proved quite valuable. Playing it wasn't always an obvious choice, as it costs a land drop and a commitment to invest further mana in future turns. But the card advantage was a great fit for a control deck like this - allowing me to spend mana without spending cards helped me maximize my resources for the late game.
- [[Rishadan Port]] filled a similar role here - it allowed me to expend mana without expending cards. It was _very_ strong in some situations, like punishing greedier 4 and 5 color decks and delaying creature lands.
- [[Toxic Deluge]] was great as expected. The life loss cost is definitely a real consideration in this environment, though.
- [[Accursed Marauder]] was quietly quite solid. I managed to bring it back a few times with [[Virtue of Persistence]] which was great.
- [[Bloodsky Berserker]] was super fan, and quite strong. It really encourages you to think more carefully about when you're casting your spells, and pays you off handsomely for it.

Other notable call outs:

- [[Treasure Cruise]] was so good. It was almost always a late game [[Ancestral Recall]]. If I was able to cast it, it was almost a guaranteed win. Cards like [[Ephara's Dispersal]] also helped get there quicker.
- [[Murderous Cut]] was also good. I often found myself with enough in my graveyard to cast both of these delve cards for their minimum cost, which is super efficient.
- [[Shark Typhoon]] is a menace. A huge flying shark protected by counterspells is hard to contend with.
- [[Languish]] won me a few games as well. Although there were a couple of times that the fact it wasn't [[Damnation]] was very relevant.

Overall, really fun to play and felt very strong.
