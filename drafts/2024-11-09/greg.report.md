This deck was perhaps a little bit lighter on 1-drop creatures than I would have expected for a pure aggro deck, but did well.
All three of my games against it were down to the wire, and could have gone either way based on draws.

First timers:

- [[March of Otherworldly Light]]
- [[Warleader's Call]]. An extra power + toughness means a good deal in this environment. The added reach late game via pinging your opponent was also very welcome here.

Noteworthy:

- [[Goblin Bombardment]] is very good. It makes removal spells feel bad and it provides much needed late-game reach. Might want a tiny bit more in the way of enchantment removal, but not much needed here.
- [[Welcoming Vampire]] is a must-kill. Can easily be an extra card each turn, especially with repeatable token generation like [[Adanto, the First Fort]].
- [[The Wandering Emperor]] used to be on my "almost too strong" list, but recently has felt exceptionally fair. Still very powerful, and super fun to play with and against. I want more Planeswalkers like this.
- [[Sevinne's Reclamation]] and [[Helping Hand]] have been very solid. There are a lot of good targets for them in this environment.
